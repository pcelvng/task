# etl 

etl contains some general purpose extractors and loaders to assist in
building etl style batch processes.

It also provides two basic batch message processing models; one model
will support a full 'etl' process to extract transform and load a batch
of records; the other model is just a simple 'el' process to 'extract' 
'load' a batch of records.
